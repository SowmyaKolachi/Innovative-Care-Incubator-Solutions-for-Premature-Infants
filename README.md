# Innovative-Care-Incubator-Solutions-for-Premature-Infants
Project Overview:
The incubator solution uses IoT tech to monitor premature infants' environment, ensuring optimal care.

Key Features:
- Real-time Monitoring: Arduino collects data from temperature, humidity, and oxygen sensors.
- Alerts and Notifications: ESP8266 sends alerts to caregivers via Wi-Fi when parameters go out of range.
- Remote Access: Firebase enables real-time data logging and mobile app access via React Native.

How it works:
- Sensors monitor incubator conditions.
- Arduino processes data and sends it to Firebase via ESP8266.
- Mobile app (React Native) displays real-time data and sends alerts.

Benefits:
- Enhanced neonatal survival rates
- Minimized infection risks
- Reduced hospital workload
